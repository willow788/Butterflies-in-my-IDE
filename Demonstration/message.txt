guys!
i think i am officially in love with turtle graphics, that's why i'm some graphs almost everyday
i learned a lot of new things while making this graph.
i will also document them and write detailed explanations of them, i'm officially loving this
i think i can be a good candidate in research files( i'm not saying that i'm extremely smaart or something it's just i love learning things and documenting them)
not the github documents, they are always written by copilot but the comments of the code, explanations and the text messages are all written by me. 
ik no one is reading these, let's be honest i've got 2 followers, one of them is my friend, so no one's watching
this makes me very confortable and at ease, idk why

but i love experimenting with these things!
bye!
