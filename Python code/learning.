hi!
this is the file that stores all the rambling that i'll type
basically all the new things that i learned making these two butterflies.
alright both the butterflies are the same but still it's good practice.

i think it would be better if i write a line by line explanation of the code, then also give what i learned new from it,
so open up another browser and split the screen into two halves.

in the 1st 4 lines, we are importing all the assets that we will be requiring to make the graph

then after a gap
we are initialising the screen and also setting the color of the screen to black, well we're giving the screen a title, and also setting up the basic dimensions of the screen. 900 x 900 right now.

then an another gap..  
then we're initialising the speed of the pen and also specifying the color of the pen and the size of the pen otherwise it won't be visible

then an another gap..
we're initialising the screen.tracer.. so that we can see the drawing process not only the output final

then after a gap..
we are specifying the no. of points, update_every which means that the screen will be updated every 8 seconds and also specifying a delay of 0.002 seconds and a margin too.

then we have another gap..
we are precomputing the points
min_y min_y max_x, max_y so that we can very easily determine the bounding box

then we're running the main loop , which will draw the butterfly
