## ✨ what is this?

sometimes you're coding late at night and you realize the prettiest things you'll see today are the graphs you're making. so here we are.  a collection of digital butterflies – delicate data visualizations that flutter across the screen because *someone* has to make beautiful things, even if it's just me, in my IDE, at 2am. 

<div align="center">

### 🌸 the collection 🌸

</div>

each butterfly is a little experiment.  a tiny triumph.  proof that even when you're debugging your life, you can still make something pretty.

> *"why butterflies?"*  
> why not? they're delicate. they transform. they exist for a brief, beautiful moment.   
> just like my motivation to code.

*butterfly. 1* - **the first one**  
the one that started it all. simple. hopeful. a little wonky.

## 📚 what i learned

check out `learnings.txt` for my rambling thoughts on what this project taught me.  

spoiler: it's probably going to be philosophical. and technical. and sad. but in a fun way.

> *note to self: actually write that file tomorrow*

## 💭 the philosophy corner

this project exists in that weird space between "productive coding" and "coping mechanism." 

is it both? is it neither? 

does it matter when the butterfly looks this good?

### ✨ features ✨

🦋 **aesthetically pleasing graphs** - because data should be beautiful  
🌙 **late night energy** - coded when the vibes are right  
💜 **made with feelings** - every commit is a journal entry  
🎨 **visual poetry** - it's not just code, it's ~art~
